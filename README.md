This is a personal website I'm making for NomadNetwork.

It's still a work in progress, but you can already test it at the following address:

### Project Roadmap

- [ ] Find an alternative header logo, current is broken on NomadNet (works on Meshchat)
- [ ] Add basic system info to the status page
- [ ] Add a guestbook page

### What is Nomad Network?

Nomad Network (NomadNet) is a terminal-based hypertext system for communicating and sharing content over delay-tolerant mesh and long-range radio networks.  
It is designed to work well over Reticulum-based networks, even on very low-bandwidth and high-latency links.  
More info and source code: [`NomadNet on GitHub`](https://github.com/markqvist/NomadNet).

### What is Reticulum?

Reticulum is a cryptographically secure networking stack built for resilient, censorship-resistant and delay-tolerant networks.  
It allows you to build mesh networks over many different physical transports (LoRa, packet radio, Ethernet, IP, serial links, etc.).
